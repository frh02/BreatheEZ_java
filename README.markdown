# MediaPipe - Holistic

Right now, I have extracted the lips from the holistic model and the end goal is to make a function to calculate the distance between the lip_landmarksp[13] and the landmark[14]. Also refer to the python implementation of this project so that you get more intuition on how to proceed with the calculation of the distance between the arms to form a "Y"
